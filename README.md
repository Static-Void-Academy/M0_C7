# M0_C7 - Employee Database 
Repository with prompt and code for Module 1, Challenge 7: Employee Database.

## Prompt
The owner of a small business tried to write a Python program to manage his employees' information, but he has no idea what he's doing.

He hired a previous consultant to write tests for him, but after the consultant left, he couldn't figure out how to use those tests.

He hired you, another consultant, to just get things working.

### Requirements
Get the tests to pass by fixing problems in `employee_database.py`. Do not touch `test_employee_database.py`.

## Example
No examples. This challenge will test and give you practice in:

- How to read other peoples' code and fix it
- How to read the tests
- How to manually debug (not using a debugging tool)

## Notes and Hints
- You don't necessarily need to know how every line in the tests work... just find out what results the tests check for.
- You can also manually test the program.
- There's more code than you're accustomed to, and some of it looks scary. Remember to just think things through and read the code carefully. Aside from `try/except` and the ternary statement, there's nothing in here you haven't seen before.

## Knowledge Tested
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Nesting and Scope
- Dictionaries
- User Input
- Basic Testing
- Basic Debugging

## Instructions
1. Make sure `pipenv` is installed. For a tutorial, see [0.3.4 - Pipenv and Python Package Management](https://sva.thinkific.com/courses/take/sva-module-0/lessons/11857539-0-3-4-pipenv-and-python-package-management)
2. Fork this repository to your own account.
3. Clone the forked repository to your local computer.
4. Run `pipenv install` to install the needed modules in a virtual environment.
5. Run `pipenv shell` to activate a virtual environment with the installed modules. Alternatively, you can run `pipenv run [PROGRAM]` instead of the usual `python3 [PROGRAM]` command.
6. Inside `employee_database.py`, you will make your changes. You're welcome to look at `test_employee_database.py` to see what's being tested and how.
7. While you're writing and/or when you're done, you can execute the provided tests to verify your program works by running `python3 test_employee_database.py`. All tests are passing if you see `OK` in the output. You can also manually test by directly running `python3 employee_database.py` and inputting your own values.
